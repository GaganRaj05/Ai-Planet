# 🧠 AI Planet - PDF Question Answering System

AI Planet is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions based on their content. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide intelligent answers extracted from the PDFs using advanced language models.

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 **Upload PDF documents** via the UI  
- 🤖 **Ask questions** related to the uploaded PDFs  
- 🧠 **Uses LangChain and LlamaIndex** for context-based answering  
- ⚡ **Backend powered by FastAPI**  
- 💻 **Frontend built with React**  
- 🗄️ **Uses sqlite3** to store extracted text and metadata  
- 🔐 **Authentication system with JWT** for login and signup  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite  
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic, uvicorn  
- **Database:** sqlite3  
- **NLP Tools:** LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI/LLMs  
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token), cookie
